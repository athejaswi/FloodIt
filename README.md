# FloodIt
Make all the cells on the board the same color. You can change cell colors by clicking on any cell of a different color. Your score and time elapsed since the beginning of the game will be displayed. Your score is calculated based on how many tiles are flooded, versus how many clicks/turns you've used so far.  "r" - reset.
