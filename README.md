# FloodIt
The objective of this game is to make all the cells on the board the same color. You can change cell colors by clicking on any cell of a different color. The time elapsed since the beginning of the game will be displayed. Your score will also be displayed. Your score is calculated based on how many tiles are flooded, versus how many clicks/turns you've used so far. The timer and score will reset every time you press the "r" button.
